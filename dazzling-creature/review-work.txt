Description:
This project creates an animated, demon-like creature with a Halloween feel. The creature flies up and down, flapping its wings with its head 
tilting slightly and its wing color pulsing like it’s alive from red to black. The different parts of the demon creature are made separately then
"combined" with translations. The flight height is controlled by two min/max points.

Use of AI:
Seemed like the vertex positions seem to be manually tweaked. The wings rotation (sin) logic might've been co-created with AI.
Considering how precise the points have to be and the simple structure, most was probably manual coding.

Topics Mastery:
· Functions: Each different "layer" was created with a separate function
· Canvas Operations: Used a lot of push-pop matrixes for piecing parts at the right places as well as rotations
· Loops: Used loop for teeth
· Scope/reusability: e.g. passed variables with global

Why Simon?:
Seems like an artist's work, inspired by one of their own drawings. Used code to bring a static image to life. Spooky season?

Basic Goals at this point in the semester:
· Write, run, and debug a simple Python script independently, without advanced IDE or AI aid. 
· Demonstrate a solid understanding of basic syntax and execution of Python/py5 
· Be comfortable with and perform simple operations with some core data types such as lists, strings, integers, Booleans 
· Use control flow statements like if-else and loops to solve small, contained problems 
· Write and call simple functions with parameters and return values 
· Showcase grasp of scope and reusability 
· Ensure code runs without syntax errors 
· Fix common mistakes such as indentation and type mismatches 
· Break down a small problem into steps and implement it in Python 
· Develop a procedural based problem solving way of thinking. 
It seems like everything is working and all these goals were met.
