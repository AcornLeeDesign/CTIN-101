# Group (not Dev) Analysis 

## Description:
This project creates an animated, demon-like creature with a Halloween feel. The creature flies up and down, flapping its wings with its head tilting slightly and its wing color pulsing like it’s alive from red to black. 

## Components - How it works
The different parts of the demon creature are made separately then "combined" with translations. 
The flight height is controlled by two min/max points.
Rotation of the wings, head tilt, and color shift are calculated with sin expression

## Use of AI:
Seemed like the vertex positions seem to be manually tweaked. The wings rotation (sin) logic might've been co-created with AI.
Considering how precise the points have to be and the simple structure, most was probably manual coding.

# Team Analysis 

## Description:
This project creates an animated, demon-like creature with a Halloween feel. The creature flies up and down, flapping its wings with its head tilting slightly and its wing color pulsing like it’s alive from red to black. 

## Components - How it works
The different parts of the demon creature are made separately then "combined" with translations to make the animation part easier - having separate functions so the body cna be animated as a whole while the body parts can animate at the same time with relative positioning. The flight height is controlled by two min/max points. Rotation of the wings, head tilt, and color shift are calculated with sin expression.

## Use of AI:
Had a large structure, so had AI help make overall structure
